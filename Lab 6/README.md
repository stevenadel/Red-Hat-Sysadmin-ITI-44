### 16.	Bonus
```
Your boss thinks itâ€™s a great idea to have one central logging server. Satisfy his requirements
Hint:
Set up rsyslogd on the "logging server" machine to accept logging messages from other machines.
On the your "workstation", set up rsyslogd to send messages to the "logging server
Test the new setup by using the logger command on the "workstation" to generate a log message
Does the message appear in the "logging server's" /var/log/messages file?
Why does this message also appear in the "workstation's" /var/log/messages file?
How could you have the message only appear in the "logging server's" files?
